Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

    Duration:
        Start Time: April 15, 2024, 10:00 AM PDT
        End Time: April 15, 2024, 2:00 PM PDT
    Impact:
        Service: Website and API
        Users Affected: 75% of users experienced slow response times or could not access the service.

Timeline:

    10:00 AM PDT: Issue detected through monitoring alerts showing increased response times.
    10:15 AM PDT: Engineers investigated database performance, assuming it was the root cause.
    11:00 AM PDT: No improvement after scaling database instances; focus shifted to network issues.
    12:00 PM PDT: Network team found a misconfigured firewall blocking traffic to the database.
    1:00 PM PDT: Incident escalated to senior engineers for resolution.
    2:00 PM PDT: Misconfigured firewall rules corrected, restoring normal service.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause: Misconfigured firewall rules blocked traffic to the database, causing service degradation.
    Resolution: Corrected firewall rules to allow traffic to the database.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements/Fixes:
        Regular audits of firewall configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
        Improved monitoring for network traffic to quickly detect and respond to similar issues.

    Tasks:
        Implement automated checks for firewall rules consistency.
        Update incident response playbook to include troubleshooting steps for network-related issues.

Lessons Learned:

    Ensure that network configurations are regularly audited and monitored to prevent similar incidents in the future.
    Implement more robust alerting mechanisms to quickly detect and respond to network issues.

Conclusion:

The outage was caused by a misconfigured firewall, which was promptly identified and corrected. Going forward, we will implement stricter monitoring and auditing practices to prevent similar incidents and improve our incident response procedures.
